# C Vending Machine 

C Vending Machine is a console-based simulation of a vending machine, developed as part of an introductory C/C++ course. The program allows users to "insert" coins, receive change, and purchase a product, emulating a real-world vending machine experience.

This project demonstrates basic C programming concepts including functions, pointers, arrays, dynamic memory allocation, and input validation.

Features

Coin Insertion: Accepts nickels (5 centimes), dimes (10 centimes), and pentes (20 centimes).

Refund System: Users can request a refund at any time, which calculates the correct change in nickels and dimes.

Price Validation: Ensures the product price is within acceptable bounds (30â€“115 centimes) and is a multiple of 5.

Product Dispensing: Automatically dispenses the product when the correct amount is inserted.

Shutdown Option: Users can shut down the vending machine at any time.

Technology Stack

Language: C

Development Focus: Function usage, pointer manipulation, memory allocation, and input handling
